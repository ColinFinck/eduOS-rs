/// A counting, blocking, semaphore.
///
/// Semaphores are a form of atomic counter where access is only granted if the
/// counter is a positive value. Each acquisition will block the calling thread
/// until the counter is positive, and each release will increment the counter
/// and unblock any threads if necessary.
///
/// # Examples
///
/// ```
///
/// // Create a semaphore that represents 5 resources
/// let sem = Semaphore::new(5);
///
/// // Acquire one of the resources
/// sem.acquire();
///
/// // Acquire one of the resources for a limited period of time
/// {
///     let _guard = sem.access();
///     // ...
/// } // resources is released here
///
/// // Release our initially acquired resource
/// sem.release();
///
/// Interface is derived from https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.7.0/src/std/sync/semaphore.rs.html
/// ```
